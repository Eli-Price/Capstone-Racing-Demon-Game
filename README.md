# Capstone Racing Demon Game

Abstract:
The project is a multiplayer online adaptation of the classic card game Racing Demon, utilizing the Phaser3 engine for 2D game development with WebGL and Canvas rendering. Synchronous gameplay presents a challenge, addressed by implementing WebSocket communication for real-time messaging between server and clients. There are many options for hosting including Google, Amazon, and many others.

The game structure supports 4-player rooms with simultaneous room handling. Server-side code manages critical calculations to prevent cheating, while client-side code handles user inputs and displaying the game state. Room management, low-latency networking, and efficient data synchronization are integral for a smooth multiplayer experience.

The UI design focuses on creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface, with feedback systems incorporating visual and audio cues for game actions. Regular performance testing and cross-browser compatibility checks are essential.

Thorough documentation, including developer documentation and player guides, is maintained for future development and debugging. Iterative testing and improvements are prioritized, possibly including a feedback system to easily deliver feedback reports as emails. Overall, the project aims to provide a stable, online multiplayer experience for Racing Demon enthusiasts.
