# phaser-typescript-vite-eslint-prettier-template

Boilerplate Phaser 3 project configured with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier for clean code
The project is based on a card creation system borrowed from another project, it may get cut later.
All that got cut, was basically useless. Gave me good ideas though.
